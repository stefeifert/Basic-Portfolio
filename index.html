        <p>I'm originally from Bethlehem, PA but I've lived most of my life living and working in and around NYC.
        I've only been living in Georgia for about 3 years, and currently reside in Decatur.</p> 
        <p>One of my greatest loves are animals - either with fur or feathers. My husband and I have two dogs, a Black 
        Lab named Bronson and a Black and Tan Coonhound named Maggie. We also have three cats, Jackson, Wendell and Grady. 
        It doesn't stop there however, since we also have three chickens, Scarlett, Penny and Rita. 
        Apart from the chickens, all of our animals are rescues, and I also volunteer at PAWS Atlanta 
        with their pet vaccination clinics.</p>
        <p>My other passion is travelling, I was a Russian Studies major at college and after graduation, 
        I lived in Moscow for a year! In total, I've visited over 20 countries.</p>
